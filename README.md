The demonstation notebook (demo_scrabble_assistant) shows how to use the dictionary class with the following examples:
* Generate a list of words, e.g. all the 3-letters words incl. 'z'
* Check if a word is valid
* Get anagrams from a set of letters (and anagrams with one supplementary letter)
* Get all the subwords from a set of letters
* Get cousin words from a word
* Get suffix words from a word
